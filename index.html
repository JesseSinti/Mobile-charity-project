    <h1>Ripple Reach  –  Expanding Minds, Expanding Futures</h1>
    <p id="infotxt">Ripple Reach is dedicated to bridging the digital divide for underserved communities by providing access to education and technology. 
        We believe that knowledge is the first drop that creates waves of opportunity.
        Our mission is to equip rural schools and marginalized learners with the tools they need to connect to the world — from low-cost tablets and internet hotspots to solar-powered charging stations. 
With every student who gains access to online learning, new skills, and global knowledge, a ripple of change begins: families gain resources, communities grow stronger, and futures open wide.
At Ripple Reach, we know that when education is within reach, possibilities are endless — and the impact is felt for generations.</p>
